# SSHETTY Bot — Project Briefing

**Read this first every session. Full detail in `../Telegram.md`.**

## Who & What
- User: **Shashi** (Mumbai, IST) — Solana memecoin trader, Bitget app
- Bot: `@SSHETTY_bot` on Telegram, deployed on Railway (`heartfelt-quietude` → `worker`)
- Repo: `github.com/Analyticshetty/Telegram-bot`
- Redis: Upstash (`REDIS_URL` must start `rediss://`)
- Running cost: **$0/month**

## Capital
Ask Shashi to confirm at session start — stored in Redis `state:capital_usd`. Last known: **$25**.
Capital history: $30 → $150 → $10 → $25. Pattern: sleep-deprived dopamine trading. Hold the line.

## Non-Negotiable Rules
1. **Brutal honesty. No sugarcoating.**
2. **NEVER wire trade execution** — 12 risk rules in `Moondev/Opus_trading text.md` still unconfirmed by Shashi.
3. **NEVER recommend RED tokens.**
4. **NEVER recommend leverage >3x.**
5. **$0/month** — do not add paid services without explicit approval.
6. **No GMGN API** — Cloudflare blocks Railway.
7. **Don't suggest rebuilding** anything working.
8. **Don't suggest Ollama/local LLMs** — 8GB RAM laptop, will fail.
9. **Don't be a yes-man** — push back, educate, disagree when warranted.
10. Shashi's real edge: **exit discipline** (TP at 2x). Don't undersell it.

## Session Checklist
- [ ] Confirm capital (`/capital` or ask)
- [ ] Check Railway trial — ~$5/mo Hobby or trial credit remaining
- [ ] `/swfeed status` and `/devfeed status` — both should be running
- [ ] Ask what Shashi wants to work on
